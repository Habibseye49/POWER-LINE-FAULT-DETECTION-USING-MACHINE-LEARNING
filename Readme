# Electrical Fault Detection and Diagnosis

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting and diagnosing electrical faults in power lines. By analyzing various electrical parameters and patterns, the system can identify and classify different types of faults, enabling prompt detection and efficient maintenance.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of power lines
- Automatic fault detection and classification
- Accurate fault diagnosis and localization
- Historical data analysis for predictive maintenance
- User-friendly interface for visualization and control

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Habibseye49/POWER-LINE-FAULT-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure the system by updating the necessary settings in the configuration file.
